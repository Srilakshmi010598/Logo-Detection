# Logo-Detection
The goal is to detect the logos/icons on a given page. 

I have used OpenCV library along with Python to do the Image Processing. I have processed the given RGB Image and converted it to a binary Image and localized the logos by detecting contours. A binary image is one whose pixels can take one of exactly two values-in this case, either black or white. Through stages of preprocessing the input image before passing on for detecting the contours, I am able to detect any colored logos or icons present on the page.
